Before you can replace node2 with node4, you must relocate the non-root aggregates that are owned by node2 to node3.

.Before you begin

After the post-checks from the previous stage complete, the resource release for node2 starts automatically. The non-root aggregates and non-SAN data LIFs are migrated from node2 to node3.

.About this task

Remote LIFs handle traffic to SAN LUNs during the upgrade procedure. Moving SAN LIFs is not necessary for cluster or service health during the upgrade.

After the aggregates and LIFs are migrated, the operation is paused for verification purposes. At this stage, you must verify whether or not all the non-root aggregates and non-SAN data LIFs are migrated to node3.

NOTE: The home owner for the aggregates and LIFs are not modified; only the current owner is modified.

.Steps

. Verify that all the non-root aggregates are online and their state on node3:
+
`storage aggregate show -node <node3> -state online -root false`
+
The following example shows that the non-root aggregates on node2 are online:
+
....
cluster::> storage aggregate show -node node3 state online -root false

Aggregate      Size         Available   Used%   State   #Vols  Nodes  RAID     Status
----------     ---------    ---------   ------  -----   -----  ------ -------  ------
aggr_1         744.9GB      744.8GB      0%     online  5      node2  raid_dp  normal
aggr_2         825.0GB      825.0GB      0%     online  1      node2  raid_dp  normal
2 entries were displayed.
....
+
If the aggregates have gone offline or become foreign on node3, bring them online by using the following command on node3, once for each aggregate:
+
`storage aggregate online -aggregate <aggr_name>`

. Verify that all the volumes are online on node3 by using the following command on node3 and examining the  output:
+
`volume show -node <node3> -state offline`
+
If any volumes are offline on node3, bring them online by using the following command on node3, once for each volume:
+
`volume online -vserver <vserver_name> -volume <volume_name>`
+
The `<vserver_name>` to use with this command is found in the output of the previous `volume show` command.

. Verify that the LIFs have been moved to the correct ports and have a status of `up`. If any LIFs are down, set the administrative status of the LIFs to `up` by entering the following command, once for each LIF:
+
`network interface modify -vserver <vserver_name> - lif <LIF_name> -home-node <node_name> - status-admin up`

. If the ports currently hosting data LIFs will not exist on the new hardware, remove them from the broadcast domain:
+
`network port broadcast-domain remove-ports`
