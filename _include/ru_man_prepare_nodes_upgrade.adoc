Before you can replace the original nodes, you must ensure that they are in an HA pair, have no missing or failed disks, can access each other's storage, and do not own data LIFs assigned to the other nodes in the cluster. You also need to collect information about the original nodes and, if the cluster is in a SAN environment, ensure that all the nodes in the cluster are in quorum.

.Steps

. Ensure that each of the original nodes has enough resources to adequately support the workload of both nodes during takeover mode.
+
Refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to _High Availability management_ and follow the _Best practices for HA pairs_ section. Neither of the original nodes should be running at more than 50 percent utilization; if a node is running at less than 50 percent utilization, it can handle the loads for both nodes during the controller upgrade.

. Complete the following substeps to create a performance baseline for the original nodes:

.. Make sure that the diagnostic user account is unlocked.
+
*Important*: The diagnostic user account is intended only for low-level diagnostic purposes and should be used only with guidance from technical support.
+
*Important*: For information about unlocking the user accounts, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _System Administration Reference_.

.. Refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _NetApp Support Site_ and download the Performance and Statistics Collector (Perfstat Converged).
+
The Perfstat Converged tool lets you establish a performance baseline for comparison after the upgrade.

.. Create a performance baseline, following the instructions on the NetApp Support Site.

. Refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _NetApp Support Site_ and open a support case on the NetApp Support Site.
+
You can use the case to report any issues that might arise during the upgrade.

. Verify that NVMEM or NVRAM batteries of node3 and node4 are charged, and charge them if they are not.
+
You need to physically check node3 and node4 to see if the NVMEM or NVRAM batteries are charged. For information about the LEDs for the model of node3 and node4, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _Hardware Universe_.
+
WARNING: *Attention* Do not try to clear the NVRAM contents. If there is a need to clear the contents of NVRAM, contact NetApp technical support.

. Check the version of ONTAP on node3 and node4.
+
The new nodes must have the same version of ONTAP 9.x installed on them that is installed on the original nodes. If the new nodes have a different version of ONTAP installed, you need to netboot the new controllers after you install them. For instructions on how to upgrade ONTAP, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to _Upgrade ONTAP_.
+
Information about the version of ONTAP on node3 and node4 should be included in the shipping boxes. The ONTAP version is displayed when the node boots up or you can boot the node to maintenance mode and run the command:
+
`version`

. Check whether you have two or four cluster LIFs on node1 and node 2:
+
`network interface show -role cluster`
+
The system displays any cluster LIFs, as shown in the following example:
+
....
cluster::> network interface show -role cluster
        Logical    Status     Network          Current  Current Is
Vserver Interface  Admin/Oper Address/Mask     Node     Port    Home
------- ---------- ---------- ---------------- -------- ------- ----
node1
        clus1      up/up      172.17.177.2/24  node1    e0c     true
        clus2      up/up      172.17.177.6/24  node1    e0e     true
node2
        clus1      up/up      172.17.177.3/24  node2    e0c     true
        clus2      up/up      172.17.177.7/24  node2    e0e     true
....

. If you have two or four cluster LIFs on node1 or node2, make sure that you can ping both cluster LIFs across all the available paths by completing the following substeps:

.. Enter the advanced privilege level:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
+
The system displays the following message:
+
....
Warning: These advanced commands are potentially dangerous; use them only when directed to do so by NetApp personnel.
Do you wish to continue? (y or n):
....

.. Enter `y`.

.. Ping the nodes and test the connectivity:
+
`cluster ping-cluster -node node_name`
+
The system displays a message similar to the following example:
+
....
cluster::*> cluster ping-cluster -node node1
Host is node1
Getting addresses from network interface table...
Local = 10.254.231.102 10.254.91.42
Remote = 10.254.42.25 10.254.16.228
Ping status:
...

Larger than PMTU communication succeeds on 4 path(s)
RPC status:
2 paths up, 0 paths down (tcp check)
2 paths up, 0 paths down (udp check)
....
+
If the node uses two cluster ports, you should see that it is able to communicate on four paths, as shown in the example.

.. Return to the administrative level privilege:
+
`set -privilege admin`

. Ensure that node1 and node2 are in an HA pair and verify that the nodes are connected to each other, and that takeover is possible:
+
`storage failover show`
+
The following example shows the output when the nodes are connected to each other and
takeover is possible:
+
....
cluster::> storage failover show
                              Takeover
Node           Partner        Possible State Description
-------------- -------------- -------- -------------------------------
node1          node2          true     Connected to node2
node2          node1          true     Connected to node1
....
+
Neither node should be in partial giveback. The following example shows that node1 is in partial giveback:
+
....
cluster::> storage failover show
                              Takeover
Node           Partner        Possible State Description
-------------- -------------- -------- -------------------------------
node1          node2          true     Connected to node2, Partial giveback
node2          node1          true     Connected to node1
....
+
If either node is in partial giveback, use the `storage failover giveback` command to perform the giveback, and then use the `storage failover show-giveback` command to make sure that no aggregates still need to be given back. For detailed information about the commands, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to _High Availability management_.

. [[man_prepare_nodes_step9]]Ensure that neither node1 nor node2 owns the aggregates for which it is the current owner (but not the home owner):
+
`storage aggregate show -node <node_name> -is-home false -fields owner-name,homename,state`
+
If neither node1 nor node2 owns aggregates for which it is the current owner (but not the home owner), the system will return a message similar to the following example:
+
....
cluster::> storage aggregate show -node node2 -is-home false -fields owner-name,homename,state
There are no entries matching your query.
....
+
The following example shows the output of the command for a node named node2 that is the home owner, but not the current owner, of four aggregates:
+
....
cluster::> storage aggregate show -node node2 -is-home false
               -fields owner-name,home-name,state

|===

. [[man_prepare_nodes_step11]] If either node1 or node2 owns aggregates for which it is the current owner but not the home owner, complete the following substeps:

.. Return the aggregates currently owned by the partner node to the home owner node:
+
`storage failover giveback -ofnode <home_node_name>`

.. Verify that neither node1 nor node2 still owns aggregates for which it is the current owner (but not the home owner):
+
`storage aggregate show -nodes <node_name> -is-home false -fields owner-name,home-name,state`
+
The following example shows the output of the command when a node is both the current owner and home owner of aggregates:
+
....
cluster::> storage aggregate show -nodes node1
          -is-home true -fields owner-name,home-name,state

4 entries were displayed.
....

. [[man_prepare_nodes_step12]] Ensure that node1 and node2 can access each other's storage and verify that no disks are missing:
+
`storage failover show -fields local-missing-disks,partner-missing-disks`
+
The following example shows the output when no disks are missing:
+
....
cluster::> storage failover show -fields local-missing-disks,partner-missing-disks

node     local-missing-disks partner-missing-disks
-------- ------------------- ---------------------
node1    None                None

....
+
If any disks are missing, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to _Disk and aggregate management with the CLI_, _Logical storage management with the CLI_, and _High Availability management_ to configure storage for the HA pair.

. Ensure that node1 and node2 are healthy and eligible to participate in the cluster:
+
`cluster show`
+
The following example shows the output when both nodes are eligible and healthy:
+
....
cluster::> cluster show

Node                  Health  Eligibility

. Set the privilege level to advanced:
+
`set -privilege advanced`

. [[man_prepare_nodes_step15]] Ensure that node1 and node2 are running the same ONTAP release:
+
`system node image show -node <node1,node2> -iscurrent true`
+
The following example shows the output of the command:
+
....
cluster::*> system node image show -node node1,node2 -iscurrent true

2 entries were displayed.
....

. Verify that neither node1 nor node2 owns any data LIFs that belong to other nodes in the cluster and check the `Current Node` and `Is Home` columns in the output:
+
`network interface show -role data -is-home false -curr-node <node_name>`
+
The following example shows the output when node1 has no LIFs that are home-owned by other nodes in the cluster:
+
....
cluster::> network interface show -role data -is-home false -curr-node node1
 There are no entries matching your query.

2 entries were displayed.
....

. If the output in <<man_prepare_nodes_step15,Step 15>> shows that either node1 or node2 owns any data LIFs home-owned by other nodes in the cluster, migrate the data LIFs away from node1 or node2:
+
`network interface revert -vserver * -lif *`
+
For detailed information about the `network interface revert` command, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _ONTAP 9 Commands: Manual Page Reference_.

. Check whether node1 or node2 owns any failed disks:
+
`storage disk show -nodelist <node1,node2> -broken`
+
If any of the disks have failed, remove them, following instructions in the _Disk and aggregate management with the CLI_. (Refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to _Disk and aggregate management with the CLI_.)

. Collect information about node1 and node2 by completing the following substeps and recording the output of each command:
+
NOTE: You will use this information later in the procedure.

.. Record the model, system ID, and serial number of both nodes:
+
`system node show -node <node1,node2> -instance`
+
NOTE: You will use the information to reassign disks and decommission the original nodes.

.. Enter the following command on both node1 and node2 and record information about the shelves, number of disks in each shelf, flash storage details, memory, NVRAM, and network cards from the output:
+
`run -node <node_name> sysconfig`
+
NOTE: You can use the information to identify parts or accessories that you might want to transfer to node3 or node4. If you do not know if the nodes are V-Series systems or have FlexArray Virtualization software, you can learn that also from the output.

.. Enter the following command on both node1 and node2 and record the aggregates that are online on both nodes:
+
`storage aggregate show -node <node_name> -state online`
+
NOTE: You can use this information and the information in the following substep to verify that the aggregates and volumes remain online throughout the procedure, except for the brief period when they are offline during relocation.

.. [[man_prepare_nodes_step19]]Enter the following command on both node1 and node2 and record the volumes that are offline on both nodes:
+
`volume show -node <node_name> -state offline`
+
NOTE: After the upgrade, you will run the command again and compare the output with the output in this step to see if any other volumes have gone offline.

. Enter the following commands to see if any interface groups or VLANs are configured on node1 or node2:
+
`network port ifgrp show`
+
`network port vlan show`
+
Make note of whether interface groups or VLANs are configured on node1 or node2; you need that information in the next step and later in the procedure.

. Complete the following substeps on both node1 and node2 to ensure that physical ports can be mapped correctly later in the procedure:

.. Enter the following command to see if there are failover groups on the node other than `clusterwide`:
+
`network interface failover-groups show`
+
Failover groups are sets of network ports present on the system. Because upgrading the controller hardware can change the location of physical ports, failover groups can be inadvertently changed during the upgrade.
+
The system displays failover groups on the node, as shown in the following example:
+
....
cluster::> network interface failover-groups show

Vserver             Group             Targets

                                      node2:e0d, node2:e0e

2 entries were displayed.
....

.. If there are failover groups present other than `clusterwide`, record the failover group names and the ports that belong to the failover groups.

.. Enter the following command to see if there are any VLANs configured on the node:
+
`network port vlan show -node <node_name>`
+
VLANs are configured over physical ports. If the physical ports change, then the VLANs will need to be re-created later in the procedure.
+
The system displays VLANs configured on the node, as shown in the following example:
+
....
cluster::> network port vlan show

Network Network
Node    VLAN Name Port    VLAN ID MAC Address
------  --------- ------- ------- ------------------
node1   e1b-70    e1b     70      00:15:17:76:7b:69
....

.. If there are VLANs configured on the node, take note of each network port and VLAN ID pairing.

. Take one of the following actions:
+

. [[man_prepare_nodes_step23]] If you do not know if node1 and node2 are in a SAN or non-SAN environment, enter the following command and examine its output:
+
`network interface show -vserver <vserver_name> -data-protocol iscsi|fcp`
+
If neither iSCSI nor FC is configured for the SVM, the command will display a message similar to the following example:
+
....
cluster::> network interface show -vserver Vserver8970 -data-protocol iscsi|fcp
There are no entries matching your query.
....
+
You can confirm that the node is in a NAS environment by using the `network interface show` command with the `-data-protocol nfs|cifs` parameters.
+
If either iSCSI or FC is configured for the SVM, the command will display a message similar to the following example:
+

. [[man_prepare_nodes_step29]]Complete the following substeps:
.. Enter the following command on one of the original nodes and record the output:
+
`service-processor show -node * -instance`
+
The system displays detailed information about the SP on both nodes.
.. Ensure that the SP status is `online`.
.. Ensure that the SP network is configured.
.. Record the IP address and other information about the SP.

+
You might want to reuse the network parameters of the remote management devices, in this case the SPs, from the original system for the SPs on the new nodes.
For detailed information about the SP, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _System Administration Reference_ and the _ONTAP 9 Commands: Manual Page Reference_.

. [[man_prepare_nodes_step30]]If you want the new nodes to have the same licensed functionality as the original nodes, enter the following command to see the cluster licenses on the original system:
+
`system license show -owner *`
+
The following example shows the site licenses for cluster1:
+
....
system license show -owner *
Serial Number: 1-80-000013
Owner: cluster1

Package           Type    Description           Expiration

Base              site    Cluster Base License  -
NFS               site    NFS License           -
CIFS              site    CIFS License          -
SnapMirror        site    SnapMirror License    -
FlexClone         site    FlexClone License     -

. Obtain new license keys for the new nodes at the  _NetApp Support Site_. Refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to _NetApp Support Site_.
+
If the site does not have the license keys you need, contact your NetApp sales representative.

. Check whether the original system has AutoSupport enabled by entering the following command on each node and examining its output:
+
`system node autosupport show -node <node1,node2>`
+
The command output shows whether AutoSupport is enabled, as shown in the following example:
+
....
cluster::> system node autosupport show -node node1,node2

Node             State     From          To                Mail Hosts

[cols="35,65"]
|===
|If the original system... |Then...

|Has AutoSupport enabled...
a|.. Go to <<man_prepare_nodes_step34,Step 34>>.
.. Go to the section link:get_address_key_management_server_encryption.html[Get an IP address of an external key management server for Storage Encryption].
|Does not have AutoSupport enabled...
a|.. Enable AutoSupport by following the instructions in the _System Administration Reference_. (Refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _System Administration Reference_.)
+
*Note:*  AutoSupport is enabled by default when you configure your storage system for the first time. Although you can disable AutoSupport at any time, you should leave it enabled. Enabling AutoSupport can significantly help identify problems and solutions should a problem occur on your storage system.

.. Go to the link:get_address_key_management_server_encryption.html[Get an IP address of an external key management server for Storage Encryption] section.

. [[man_prepare_nodes_step34]]Verify that AutoSupport is configured with the correct mailhost details and recipient e-mail IDs by entering the following command on both of the original nodes and examining the output:
+
`system node autosupport show -node node_name -instance`
+
For detailed information about AutoSupport, refer to link:other_references.html[References] to link to the _System Administration Reference_ and the _ONTAP 9 Commands: Manual Page Reference_.

. [[man_prepare_nodes_step35,Step 35]] Send an AutoSupport message to NetApp for node1 by entering the following command:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node node1 -type all -message "Upgrading node1 from platform_old to platform_new"`
+
NOTE: Do not send an AutoSupport message to NetApp for node2 at this point; you do so later in the procedure.

. [[man_prepare_nodes_step36, Step 36]] Verify that the AutoSupport message was sent by entering the following command and examining its output:
+
`system node autosupport show -node <node1> -instance`
+
The fields `Last Subject Sent:` and `Last Time Sent:` contain the message title of the last message sent and the time the message was sent.
