Some issues can occur during different stages of the procedure.

== Unexpected "storage failover show" command output

During the procedure, if the node that hosts all data aggregates panics or is rebooted accidentally, you might see unexpected output for the `storage failover show` command before and after the reboot, panic, or power cycle.

.About this task

You might see unexpected output from the `storage failover show` command in Stage 2, Stage 3, Stage 4, or Stage 5.

The following example shows the expected output of the `storage failover show` command if there are no reboots or panics on the node that hosts all the data aggregates:

....
cluster::> storage failover show

                   Takeover
Node     Partner   Possible  State Description
-------  --------  --------- -----------------
node1    node2     false     Unknown
node2    node1     false     Node owns partner aggregates as part of the non-disruptive head upgrade procedure. Takeover is not possible: Storage failover is disabled.
....

The following example shows the output of the `storage failover show` command after a reboot or panic:

....
cluster::> storage failover show

                   Takeover
Node     Partner   Possible  State Description
-------  --------  --------- -----------------
node1    node2     -         Unknown
node2    node1     false     Waiting for node1, Partial giveback, Takeover is not possible: Storage failover is disabled
....

Although the output says that a node is in partial giveback and that storage failover is disabled, you can disregard this message.

.Steps

No action is required; continue with the node-pair upgrade procedure.
