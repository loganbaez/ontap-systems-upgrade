Having relocated node2's non-root aggregates to node3, you now must relocate them from node3 to node4.

.Steps

. [[man_relocate_3_4_Step1]]Enter the following command on either controller, and examine the output to identify which non-root aggregates to relocate:
+
`storage aggregate show -owner-name <node3> -home-id <node2_system_id>`

. Relocate the aggregates by completing the following substeps:

.. Access the advanced privilege level by entering the following command on either node:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
.. Enter the following command:
+
`storage aggregate relocation start -node <node3> -destination <node4> -aggregate-list <aggr_name1, aggr_name2...> -ndo-controller-upgrade true`
+
The aggregate list is the list of aggregates owned by node4 that you obtained in <<man_relocate_3_4_Step1,Step 1>>.
.. When prompted, enter `y`.
+
Relocation occurs in the background. It could take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes to relocate an aggregate. The time includes both client outage and non-outage portions. The command does not relocate any offline or restricted aggregates.
.. Return to the admin level:
+
`set -privilege admin`

. [[step3]]Check the relocation status:
+
`storage aggregate relocation show -node <node3>`
+
The output will display `Done` for an aggregate after it has been relocated.
+
NOTE: Wait until all the node2 aggregates have been relocated to node4 before proceeding to the next step.

. Take one of the following actions:
+

.. Check the EMS logs for the corrective action.
.. Perform the corrective action.
.. Access the advanced privilege level by entering the following command on either node:
+
`set -privilege advanced`
.. Relocate any failed or vetoed aggregates:
+
`storage aggregate relocation start -node <node3> destination <node4> -aggregate-list <aggr_name1, aggr_name2...> ndo-controller-upgrade true`
+
The aggregate list is the list of failed or vetoed aggregates.
.. When prompted, enter `y`.
.. Return to the admin level by entering the following command:
+
`set -privilege admin`

If necessary, you can force the relocation using one of the following methods:

* Overriding veto checks:
+
`storage aggregate relocation start -override-vetoes -ndo-controller-upgrade`
* Overriding destination checks:
+
`storage aggregate relocation start -override-destination-checks -ndocontroller-upgrade`

. [[man_relocate_3_4_Step5]]Verify that all node2 non-root aggregates are online and their state on node4:
+
`storage aggregate show -node <node4> -state offline -root false`
+
The node2 aggregates were listed in the output of the command in <<man_relocate_3_4_Step1,Step 1>>.

. If any aggregate has gone offline or become foreign, bring it online by using the following command for each aggregate:
+
`storage aggregate online -aggregate <aggr_name>`

. Verify that all the volumes in node2 aggregates are online on node4:
+
`volume show -node <node4> -state offline`

. If any volumes are offline on node4, bring them online:
+
`volume online -vserver <vserver-name> -volume <volume_name>`

. Send a post-upgrade AutoSupport message to NetApp for node4:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node <node4> -type all -message "<node2> successfully upgraded from <platform_old> to <platform_new>"`
