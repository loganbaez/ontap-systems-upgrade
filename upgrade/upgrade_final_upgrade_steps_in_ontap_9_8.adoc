summary: To complete the procedure of upgrading by moving storage, you must delete any unused ports and LIFs from the new nodes, re-enable storage failover or high availability, configure the Service Processor \(SP\), install new licenses, and set up AutoSupport. You might also need to set up Storage or Volume Encryption and configure the FC or CNA ports.

To complete the procedure of upgrading by moving storage, you must delete any unused ports and LIFs from the new nodes, re-enable storage failover or high availability, configure the Service Processor (SP), install new licenses, and set up AutoSupport. You might also need to set up Storage or Volume Encryption and configure the FC or CNA ports.

.Before you begin
These steps apply to systems running ONTAP 9.8. If you are running ONTAP 9.7 or earlier, you must use the procedure in xref:upgrade-final-steps-ontap-9-7-or-earlier-move-storage.adoc[Performing final upgrade steps in ONTAP 9.7 or earlier].

.Steps
. If your system is running ONTAP 9.7 or earlier, *STOP*. You must use the procedure in xref:upgrade-final-steps-ontap-9-7-or-earlier-move-storage.adoc[Performing final upgrade steps in ONTAP 9.7 or earlier].
. From the storage system prompt, display information about LIFs:
+
`network interface show`
. If you are in a SAN environment, delete unused LIFs from the port set so that you can remove them:
.. Display the port set list:
+
`lun portset show`
.. Remove any unused LIFs from the port set:
+
`lun portset remove`
. Remove each unused LIF from the new nodes:
+
`network interface delete`
. Re-enable storage failover or high availability on the new node pair as needed:
+
[options="header" cols="1,2"]
|===
| If you have a...| Then...

a|
Two-node cluster
a|
Re-enable high availability: `cluster ha modify -configured true`
a|
A cluster with more than two nodes
a|
Re-enable storage failover: `storage failover modify -node node_name -enabled true`
|===

. Configure the SP on the new nodes as needed:
+
`system service-processor network modify`
. Install new licenses on the new nodes as needed:
+
`system license add`
. Set up AutoSupport on the new nodes:
+
`system node autosupport modify`
. From each new node, send a post-upgrade AutoSupport message to technical support:
+
`system node autosupport invoke -node node_name -type all -message "MAINT=END node_name successfully upgraded from platform_old to platform_new"`
. Restore Storage or Volume Encryption functionality by using the appropriate procedure in the _NetApp Encryption Power Guide_.
+
https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/encryption-at-rest/index.html[Manage encryption with the CLI]
+
Use one of the following procedures, depending on whether you are using onboard or external key management:

 ** "`Restoring onboard key management encryption keys`"
 ** "`Restoring external key management encryption keys`"

. If the new nodes have FC ports (onboard or on FC adapters), onboard CNA ports, or a CNA card, configure the FC or CNA ports by entering the following command at the storage system prompt:
+
`system node hardware unified-connect modify -node node-name -adapter adapter-name -mode {fc|cna} -type {target|initiator}`
+

+

+
You can modify the CNA configuration only when the CNA adapters are offline.

. Set up a switchless cluster on the new nodes if necessary.

+
https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMP1140535[Migrating to a two-node switched cluster with NetApp CN1610 cluster switches]

. As needed, decommission the original systems through the NetApp Support Site to inform NetApp that the systems are no longer in operation and can be removed from support databases:
 .. Log in to the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/global/dashboard[NetApp Support] site.
 .. Click the link *My Installed Systems*.
 .. On the Installed Systems page, enter the serial number of the old system in the form and then click *Go!*
 .. On the Decommission Form page, fill out the form and click *Submit*.

.After you finish
You have completed the upgrade procedure.
